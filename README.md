# Stacks Smart Contracts

This repo contains a few smart contracts I built while learning Clarity on the Stacks blockchain.

I created these to practice deploying real contracts on mainnet and to better understand how things work on-chain.

## Contracts Included

- Counter
- Owner storage
- Basic voting
- Simple token
- NFT minting
- Basic staking
- Simple escrow

## Deployment

All contracts were deployed on Stacks Mainnet using Hiro Deploy.

(Add contract address here after deployment)

## Note

These contracts are for learning purposes only and are not production ready.
